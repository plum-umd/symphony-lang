Msort
  BGV
    Cond(S,S,S) (ints)
    S ≤ S       (ints)

Qsort
  BGW, SPDZ
    Cond(S,S,S) (ints)
    S ≤ S       (ints)
    S + S       (ints)
    S - S       (ints)

GCD/Euclid
  Yao, BGV
    S ≡ const   (ints)
    Cond(S,S,S) (ints)
    S % S       (ints)
    S < S       (ints)

Karmakar
  SPDZ (with floats)
    Cond(S,const,S)
    sqrt S
    S ≡ const
    S + S
    S + const   -- ?
    S * S
    S * const   -- ?
    S / S
    -- (↓ Low priority (only needed if early returns are required))
    Cond(S,S,S)
    S ≤ S

DB-Stats (Unsure about this one until it's finished)
  BGV
    Cond(S,S,S) (unsigned ints)
    S ≡ S       (unsigned ints)
    S < S       (unsigned ints)
    S - S       (unsigned ints, looks like it shouldn't be possible to underflow)
    -- (↓ used only for avg and std-dev over lists of secrets with secret lengths)
    S + S       (unsigned ints)
    S * S       (unsigned ints)
    S / S       (unsigned ints)

ATQ
  BGW, SPDZ
    Cond(S,S,S) (ints, bools, and principals)
    S ≡ S       (ints, bools, and principals)
    S ≤ S       (for sorting a list of ints)
    S % 2       (or is-even)
