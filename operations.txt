Msort
  BGV
    Cond(S,S,S)
    S ≤ S

Qsort
  BGW, SPDZ
    Cond(S,S,S)
    S ≤ S
    S + S
    S - S

GCD/Euclid
  Yao, BGV
    S ≡ const
    Cond(S,S,S)
    S % S
    S < S

Karmakar
  SPDZ (with floats)
    Cond(S,const,S)
    sqrt S
    S ≡ const
    S + S
    S + const   -- ?
    S * S
    S * const   -- ?
    S / S
    (↓ Low priority (only needed if early returns are required))
    Cond(S,S,S)
    S ≤ S

DB-Stats
  BGV
    Cond(S,S,S)
    S ≡ S
    S < S
    (↓ used for avg and std-dev over lists of secrets with secret lengths)
    S + S
    S * S
    S / S

ATQ
  BGW, SPDZ
    Cond(S,S,S)
    S ≡ S
    S < S
    (↓ used for testing for dummy data, might be able to remove these)
    S < const
    S || S
    S && S
