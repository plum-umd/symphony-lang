* Items for tomorrow
  * Updating the slides on specurity specs
* Karmarkar updates
  * Computing iterations: no inherent leakage. Apparently in tension
    with writing code that computes a bound on iterations based on
    private inputs. Solution: have a special loop on private iteration
    counts that really just iterates on a public constant.
  * Monadic library for early returns: waffling on how much to use it.
  * Implementing a matrix algorithm that they'd previously left
    implicit, but now added pseudocode.
  * Otherwise, trying to make pseudocode line up with theirs
    line-by-line as much as possible. Will probably use arrays.
* follow-up on SPDZ support
* follow-up on Verification support

* Requests for team
  * Write security specs for all challenge problems

* Next steps
  * Finishing next version of Karmarkar
  * Mockup PSL programs with verification
  * Write-up security specs?
