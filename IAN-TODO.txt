TODO
====

1. PSI in PSL using Yao
2. Figure out how to implement `send`
3. Tournament in PSL (depends on (2))
3. Benchmarks -- gate count (use DavidH fork of EMP), and end-to-end runtime, PSL vs. OblivC
   - gcd
   - hamming
   - edit-distance
   - bio-matching
   - k-means
   - db-analytics
   - psi

Notes
=====

2. Hopefully I can implement `send` in PSL once I figure out what is causing EMP to block
   - Consider adding print statements to `reveal` in sh_gen.h and sh_eva.h to debug EMP hanging
   - DavidH: add io->flush() to reveal? That might cause EMP to stop hanging.

DONE
====

1. Modify tournament.psl to restrict bundles
2. GCD in PSL using Yao
3. Implement multi-session EMP
   - Allows a party (`A` below) to be engaged in 2-party Yao w/ multiple parties (`B` and `C` below) at the same time
   - Ex. `let x = share {yao:A→A,B} ... in let y = share {yao:A→A,C} ... in ...`
