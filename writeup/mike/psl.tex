\section{Syntax}

The syntax of core PSL is in Figure~\ref{fig:syntax}.

\subsection{Types}

Raw types $\omega$ are normal types (numbers, pairs, lists,
functions). Types $\tau$ are either raw types $\omega$, which mean
that they are visible to all parties (who agree on their values) in
the clear, or they are security types $\sectyp{\omega}{\phi}{P}$. The
structure of the latter is a the raw type $\omega$, the \emph{format}
$\phi$, and visibility $P$, which is a list of principals who can
access/see the value.  The raw type indicates the basic type of the
value (function, number, list, etc.), while the format is the
interesting part. It has three variants:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{secret shares} $\sshare\psi$, which indicate a single
  value that is secret-shared among the given set of parties $P$,
  amenable to MPC using protocol $\psi$ (e.g., BGW, GMW, Yao).
\item \emph{secrets} \ssec, which indicate a single value known to
  (accessible by) those parties in the set $P$, but no others.
\item \emph{maps} \isec, which indicate a single variable for which
  each principal in $P$ may have a distinct value, known only to that
  principal. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Terms}



\section{Typing}

We should only permit operations among values of exactly the same type
$\tau$. That is, $\ebinop{e_1}{e_2}$ type checks if both $e_1$ and
$e_2$ have exactly the same type $\tau$.

Given this, we might like to employ subtyping. Off the top of my
head, I think we can support the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item An \ssec $P$ can be coerced to \ssec $Q$ when $Q \subseteq
  P$. That is, a shared value visible to a larger principal set can be
  viewed as visible to a smaller one. The same is true of \isec. (This
  assumes that \ssec and \isec are for immutable values; subtyping
  would not be allowed if there's mutation, as usual.)
\item There is no subtyping arrangement for \sshare -- all parties have
  to be present, and additional parties are not allowed.
\end{itemize}

The $\ereveal{e}$ construct takes as its argument something of type
$\sectyp{\omega}{\sshare{\psi}}{P}$ and produces a value of type
$\sectyp{\omega}{\ssec}{P}$. That is, it forces the secure computation
to produce a result, and reveals that result to the involved
principals $P$.

The type of $\epar{P}{e} $ should be an $\sectyp{\omega}{\isec}{P}$
type. This is because $e$ is executed independently by each principal
$p \in P$. There are constraints on the type of $e$. Off the top of my
head:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Only types with visibility $P$ are allowed. We can use
    subtyping as needed. 
  \item We can insert nested Par blocks, with a subset of principals,
    I think. However, their results will only be visible to subsequent
    par blocks with the same principal set (not the parent).
\end{itemize}

\section{Semantics}

The semantics is inspired by that of Wysteria, but relaxed since
secure blocks are no longer explicit, but implied by the type
structure. 

\subsection{Single threaded}

\subsection{Distributed}

Here we outline the ideal-world semantics in a distributed fashion.

\section{Notes/To-do}

\begin{itemize}
\item Add effect $\epsilon$ to arrows?
\item General sum types? Why do we need lists, if we have these?
\item 
\end{itemize}
