\section{README}

This is a copy of Mike's version; the only changes are to the syntax, typing, and subtyping rules (not the text).

In my view, the biggest change is viewing sums and encrypted sums as a unifying concept for the sorts of ``things'' that can be shared and revealed.

Some of the impacts of this change:

\begin{itemize}
\item Sums and functions (and primitives like nat which can be thought of as sums) are the only types that it makes sense to be "located somewhere". In your version, you already have the notion that functions can be known to a fixed set of parties. I've simply extended this to sums (and nats). Because these things are, by definition, located at some parties, we can unify raw types and types.

\item I added an explicit "encrypted sum" type which is parameterized by a protocol. This makes sense because sums (corresponding to booleans, arithmetic values, and combinations thereof) are the only real encryptions we have. This rules out the possibility of, say, a share of a function which it is not necessarily clear how to do. This also means that "formats" can be removed, since they are only needed for encrypted sums. (Encrypted sums could probably be unified with sums by including a "cleartext" protocol, but I'm not sure it's worth doing).

\item Many of the typing rules become simpler. For example, pair degenerates to its typical formulation in most type systems. This is because the knownness of objects is tracked by sums and functions, so we don't need an player annotation for tuples. I'd also like to point out this is very much in line with the change to function application discussed yesterday: It's fine to have a pair of values that are known to only a subset of the players in scope. Elimination forms are the only place we need to worry about who is in scope.

\item Share and reveal are generalized to coercion operations between sums and encrypted sums (instead of nats).

\item I went ahead and generalized conditionals/mux's to work over sums/encrypted sums.

\item I added a subtyping rule for sums that matches the existing rules (adjusted to the changes I made)
\end{itemize}

Let me know if you have any thoughts or questions!

\section{TO DO}

\begin{itemize}
\item list types (can't encrypt)
\item sum types (can encrypt -- the encrypted part is the boolean as
  to which branch you are in. Constructors need to provide both
  options; case statements result in every possibility being executed)
\item drop $\top$ ?
\item I've dropped wire bundles and first-class principals, for
  now. These allow for generic, $N$-party computations. Will want
  later.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Wire bundles. Can we encode these? We now allow tuples whose
    components $i$ have visibility $P_i \subseteq Q$ where $Q$ is the
    visibility of the entire tuple.
  \item Solo mode
  \item First-class principal sets, as data, and appearing in
    syntactic forms (e.g., $\ereveal{P}{Q}{e}$ should be
    $\ereveal{e_q}{e_q}{e}$ where $e_P$ and $e_q$ are principal sets).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Syntax}
  
The syntax of core PSL is in Figure~\ref{fig:syntax}.

Raw types $\omega$ are normal types (numbers, pairs, functions). Types
$\tau$ have form $\sectyp{\omega}{\phi}{m}$, which includes a the raw
type $\omega$, the \emph{format} $\phi$, and the \emph{mode}
$m$, which is a list of principals who can access/see the value (if
it's $\top$, then all involved principals can see the value). The raw
type indicates the basic type of the value (function, number, list,
etc.), while the format is either \emph{secret shares} $\sshare\psi$,
which indicate a single value that is secret-shared among the given
set of parties $m$, amenable to MPC using protocol $\psi$ (e.g., BGW,
GMW, Yao), or \emph{secrets} \ssec, which indicate a single value
known to (accessible by) those parties in the set $m$, but no others.
% \item \emph{maps} \isec, which indicate a single variable for which
%   each principal in $P$ may have a distinct value, known only to that
%   principal. 

% \mwh{Ramble follows; I think the upshot is that this doesn't work}
% We make shares explicitly among some set of principals operating in
% lockstep. So, shares of $e$ to $P$ require being in a par block
% involving $Q \supseteq P$. But in Wysteria, you can only access a wire
% bundle value in par mode if it's a singleton. This is to prevent Alice
% and Bob access their values, which would be OK if subset was OK, and
% then summing them up. I think this has to be in a sec block.

% Should secure mode always return a share type? Thus, Wysteria is
% reveal P (sec P e) ? But this seems not to work with the above. It
% requires I explicitly share with a subset of principals, rather than
% implicitly share with all of them on return.

\section{Semantics}

The semantics is inspired by that of Wysteria, in there being a single
program involving multiple, lock-step principals. However, the notion
of secure mode has disappeared. We just have a mode $m$ which is
either $\top$, meaning all principals are conceptually executing the
present expression, or $P$ indicating that the principals
$p \in P$ are executing it, but other principals $q \not\in P$ are not
(they skip it). The computation always starts in mode $\top$, i.e.,
with all principals. Thus, each principal is running the same program,
but it will skip those blocks of code that don't apply to it.  A key
goal of the system is that all parties are ``present'' to perform
joint-secure operations when they need to be.

Our hoped-for invariant of the semantics is that all parties $p \in P$
will execute $e$ in $\epar{P}{e}$. Within $e$, there may be variables
$x$ that are only visible to some set $Q \subseteq P$. For those
$p \not\in Q$, it should be sufficient to store $\langle \rangle$
(unit) in this variable---it will never be ``destructed'' and is just
a placeholder.

Cryptographic computations are those over values of
$\sectyp{\omega}{\sshare{\psi}}{m}$ type. Whenever something of this
type ends up in destruct position (e.g., $\ebinop{e_1}{e_2}$) instead
of actually doing the computation, we can think of the operation as
being made into a thunk.\footnote{Behind the scenes the operation
  might actually take place, e.g., when adding shares or communicating
  to multiply them. Or the frozen operation might result in a circuit
  being constructed.} For example, if we do $\ebinop{e_1}{e_2}$ and
$e_1$ and $e_2$ are both shares (i.e., of type $\sshare{\psi}$), then
the result is that both parties will construct a circuit over those
shares, locally. The $\ereveal{P}{Q}{e}$ construct takes as its argument
a share and forces the computation to happen. That is, at that moment
the secure computation will be forced to completion, and the result
revealed to the involved principals $Q$.

Not all operations can happen cryptographically. For example, a
$\kw{mux}$ operation can, and thus can operate directly on shares, but
a conditional $\kw{if}$ cannot---it operates on cleartext values,
running on each host.

\caption{Typing rules}
\label{fig:typing}
\end{figure}

The typing judgment's rules are defined in Figure~\ref{fig:typing}.
The typing judgment has form $\hastyp{\Gamma}{m}{e}{\tau}$. It states
that under context $\Gamma$, expression $e$ has type $\tau$ when
evaluating in mode $m$. These rules reference the judgment
$m \vdash m;$ says that principals designated in $m'$ are
\emph{present} when executing in mode $m$. $m \vdash m'$ holds when
$m = \top$ or $m = Q$ and $m' = P$ and $P \subseteq Q$.

Rule~\rulelab{E-Nat} types a (private) constant; it inherits the
visibility of the current mode. Rule~\rulelab{E-Read} types the
\kw{read} command; since it will produce a different value at each
location, it must be run in the visibility of a single principal ($m$
must be a singleton set).

Jumping ahead, rule~\rulelab{E-Par} runs its expression $e$ in par
mode involving principals $P$; these principals must be compatible
with the current mode $m$ (i.e., they must be a subset of them). This
coercion is useful for making the requirements of other rules match
the expected mode; the rule is also an important hint to the execution
engine about which parties will run a particular block.

Rule~\rulelab{E-Sub} is also useful for making type requirements match
up. The subtyping judgment is given in Figure~\ref{fig:sub}.

Rules~\rulelab{E-Pair} and~\rulelab{E-Access} type introduction and
elimination of pairs. A pair's components must have the 
at least the same visibility $m$ as the pair itself. They are not required to have the
same format; e.g., $\phi_1$ could be a share, while $\phi_2$ could be
a normal value. Note that pairs themselves are never shared, but their
contents can be. \mwh{Enforce this?}

Rule~\rulelab{E-Share} type share introduction, the basis for all secure
multiparty computations. The $P$ argument indicates the principal
doing the sharing, while the $Q$ argument indicates the principals to
which to share $e$ (which must be a normal (non-share)
value). This value of $e$ must be visible in the current mode ($m \vdash P$)
and the principals $Q$ must be present as well. Finally, the value
must be a number; neither pairs nor functions can be shares. 
\mwh{Should we require the share's visibility $m'$ to be singleton?
  Otherwise it will be unclear who should be sharing the value known
  to multiple parties.}

Rule~\rulelab{E-Reveal} types share elimination, i.e., converting a
share to a normal value. In essence, it forces the secure computation
(which we are thinking of as a thunk) to produce a result, and reveals
that result held by principals $P$ to the specified principals
$Q$. The rule requires that the current mode includes those in $Q$,
and those $P$ who hold the shares. (We write $\omega$ for the type
here, but per \rulelab{E-Share} this will always be $\tnat$.)

Rule~\rulelab{E-Binop} types arithmetic computations on both shares
and normal values---both arguments must have the same type (i.e., both
shares or both normal values, with the same visibility), and match the
current mode. Note that this rule precludes adding a 
share and a normal value; you can always do this by converting the
latter to a share (the compiler can be smart about this).

Rule~\rulelab{E-Mux} types multiplexing. The semantics is to evaluate
both branches (second and third arguments), and choose the result to
return based on the first argument's ultimate result. These are all
(compatible) shares, so we can think of this as making a multiplexor
circuit. 

Rule~\rulelab{E-Cond} types conditionals on normal values, i.e., the
conditional will run on each principal in mode $m$. It can return
shares or normal values, as desired. 

\mwh{Say more about the var, abs, app rules. The key here is that the
  variable rule does not require $\tau$'s visibility to match the
  current mode. The visibility requirement will be enforced later. The
  abs rule needs to think about variables added in the closure. The
  app rule takes this into account.}

% The type of $\epar{P}{e} $ is $\sectyp{\omega}{\isec}{P}$
% type. This is because $e$ is executed independently by each principal
% $p \in P$. There are constraints on the type of $e$. Off the top of my
% head:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item All types with visibility $P$ are allowed. We can use subtyping
%   (to $Q \subset P$) as needed.
%   \item We can insert nested Par blocks, with a subset of principals,
%     I think. However, their results will only be visible to subsequent
%     par blocks with the same principal set (not the parent).
%   \item Conditional execution $\econd{e_1}{e_2}{e_3}$ when $e_1$ could
%     contain an $\isec$ needs to be limited. The issue will be if $e_2$
%     has a secure computation inside it; not all parties $P$ will
%     necessarily reach this point, because their values may differ in
%     $e_1$. Remedies:
%     \begin{itemize}
%       \item Only allow conditionals in Par blocks when $P$ is a singleton, or
%       \item Forbid computations on shares inside the branches of a
%         conditional when the guard involves an \isec.
%       \end{itemize}

\paragraph{Subtyping}

We have subtyping $\issub{\tau_1}{\tau_2}$, which indicates when
$\tau_1$ can be used as $\tau_2$. The rules are in
Figure~\ref{fig:sub}. \mwh{These are wrong! Need to be thinking about
  shares vs. normal values. Principle is that the visibility of normal
  values can decrease; if $P$ know a value, then we can pretend $Q
  \subseteq P$ do. But for shares we have to leave things
  invariant. For a function's assumed mode, I don't think we can
  change it---all prescribes principals must be present.}


\section{DEPRECATED: Encoding in Wysteria}

I'm starting to wonder if our idea from way back --- Wysteria with
small extensions --- is all we really needed, where the current approach
to PSL is just this system with some inference added in. Those
extensions are:
\begin{itemize}
\item that you can create shares for a subset of parties in a secure
  block. Thus, for Alice to create shares for Bob and Charlie, all
  three join the secure block, and then create shares from Alice's
  value. We also need to be able to reconstitute shares for a subset
  of parties; i.e., if there are shares between A and B, we can make a
  secure block with A, B, and C, and reconstitute the shares within
  it. 
\item some kind of seal/unseal primitives for making $\ssec$ values, as
in Wys$^\star$, so as to avoid the weird $\Gamma$ in the Wysteria
paper. I think this also has the benefit that you can use subtyping to
make a sealed value less visible. But maybe this should be a wire
bundle instead, so the runtime semantics is clear?

Then PSL is basically inference and encoding down to this.

\paragraph{Share primitive} In PSL you can write \texttt{share $P$
  $e$}, which means to secret-share $e$ among principals $P$. It might
be that $e$ is owned by some principal $p$ not in $P$. In our encoding
we do this via \texttt{sec $\{p\}\cup{P}$ (makesh $P$ $e$)}.

\paragraph{Secure computation} In PSL everything you compute on
securely is conceptually a share, and only by explicitly revealing a
share do you get a value. The default in Wysteria is the
opposite. Thus the encoding of $e_1 \oplus e_2$ in PSL, where $e_1$
and $e_2$ are both share types over the same principal $P$, would be
\texttt{sec $P$ (makesh $P$ ((combsh $e_1$) $\oplus$ (combsh
  $e_2$)))}. The encoding for PSL's \texttt{reveal $P$ $e$} would be
\texttt{sec $R$ (let x = combsh $e$ in wire $P$ x)} where $e$ is
a share over principals $Q$ and $Q \cup P = R$. 

\paragraph{SIMD computations resulting in principal mapped values} In
the euclid example, we have something like
\begin{verbatim}
  let ab = {par:A,B} read int "euclid.txt"
\end{verbatim}
The idea is that \verb+ab+ is a $\isec$ value for $A$ and $B$. In
normal Wysteria you can only call \texttt{read} in a par block with a
single principal, but we can encode something like the above using
\texttt{wapp}. Basically \texttt{par $P$ e} in PSL is \texttt{wapp $P$
  ($\lambda$ x. par x $e$)} where \texttt{x} will be bound to the principal
executing $e$. It's not mentioned in the Wysteria paper, but I suspect
that the lambda term should executing $e$ in par mode anyway, so I'm
not sure why we have to specify it.
